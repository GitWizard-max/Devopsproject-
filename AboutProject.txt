The devops  project hosted on GitHub is a web-based application designed to simulate the core functionalities of a digital bookstore. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project provides users with a clean and interactive interface where they can browse a selection of books categorized by genre, author, and title. It includes key features such as a homepage showcasing featured books, a catalog page with listings and filters, and an interactive shopping cart system that allows users to add or remove items seamlessly.

This project emphasizes front-end development principles and demonstrates a solid understanding of UI/UX design, client-side scripting, and DOM manipulation. It can serve as a base model for an e-commerce platform, with room for backend integration, user authentication, and payment gateway setup in future enhancements. Ideal for educational and portfolio purposes, this project reflects practical implementation of a real-world application and serves as a stepping stone for more advanced web development projects.
